## Hookyd

Small, api-driven utility to run hookit hooks on a remote machine.

## Status

Complete/Stable

## Todo

- documentation
- implement ssl
- implement authentication layer

### Notes

Was not intended to run on a public network. Will need an authentication layer before one should consider running hookyd on an insecure/unfirewalled public network.
